Ethics intend to understand how actions in archives can affect and be affected by individual and organizational action and entrenched social practices. For instance, an archive may have full legal control on an object. But a researcher’s use of the object could inflict harm on the creator of the object, even if the use cannot be legally restricted.  </p><p>A code of ethics is a guiding principle for a profession to abide by in the conduct of its work. It seeks to establish standards to which the profession holds itself in fulfilling its role in society. For the archiving profession this is the role of preserving tangible and intangible culture for posterity. Archivists receive, appraise, select, describe, organise, conserve and make available records of historical value. Archives underpin the writing of history and are important to humanity as a whole in understanding their place in the world. They serve the purpose of documenting the memory of humankind. Archives take many different forms and shapes and this fosters a diversity of narratives in how we tell our stories.  </p><p>The Code of Ethics is committed to upholding this diversity. It follows the assertion of the archivist, Terry Cook: We Are What We Keep.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> It recognises that the ways in which we create, contest and assert facts about our history, society and culture are deeply embedded in what we choose to keep and, equally, what we do not keep. Archives, as Verne Harris famously argued, are but a distorted sliver of a sliver of reality.<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> Our effort as archivists is to preserve as many of these slivers as will assist us in telling our histories in a multitude of voices and cadences. To achieve this, ethical codes for the archival profession must include all aspects of the archival process – acquisitions (and in some cases creation), custody, description, organisation, preservation, access, and outreach.  </p><p>This Code of Ethics was produced by the Working Group on Ethics that comprised 12 archivists from across the country. This Working Group met as part of Milli Sessions 2022, organized by the Milli Archives Collective,<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> a network of individuals and communities interested in the nurturing of archives, especially in South Asia. These are archivists from government archives, corporate archives, community archives, art archives, archives of universities, oral histories, and music, digital humanists, and historians and archivists who have worked at archives in different capacities. This section of the guidebook is voiced in the first person plural to reflect upon the collective effort of having arrived at this code. <em>Each statement in this code reflects a consensus in the working group on what constitutes ethical practice in the archives. The first person plural voice also indicates an aspirational ethic that we are committed to pursuing and supporting.</em>  </p><p>The Code of Ethics aims to be as flexible as the archives we work in. They are a point of departure from which archives are encouraged to take their own paths relevant to their specific contexts. It has evolved over years of debates about archival ethics within communities that work with archives in India. It has emerged from a consultative process with participating archivists from various institutions and individual archivists across India. The code is accompanied by commentary that emerged during these discussions to help those who refer to it unpack the thinking that informed them. It recognises that archives are very diverse, and often faced with very specific ethical questions that cannot be addressed by a blanket statement or code. The code seeks to outline a framework for the practice of care and integrity that we aspire to bring to the archives and help archivists apply it to their collections and practices.  </p><p>This code follows the traditional archival workflow. We recognise that in some archives these may run simultaneously and that there are other parts of the workflow such as co-creation, digitisation or born-digital access that it does not currently address adequately. This code also draws on governing principles outlined in the ICA’s Universal Declaration on Archives (2011),<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> Code of Ethics (1996),<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> and Principles of Access to Archives (2012).<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup> We are putting together this code as a rough guideline for archives in India to work toward, but not as a prescription or pledge. We envision that the code will develop with feedback from the archival community to be more inclusive of these practices.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="archival-ethics-a-code">Archival Ethics: A Code<a class="hash-link" href="#archival-ethics-a-code" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-accountability">1.
